# Deviations / masks / floors ledger

Append-only, and written at the moment a decision is made — not reconstructed at
the end of a round, when the reason has already been lost. An entry is never
edited to be right: a later entry corrects an earlier one and says which.

Every entry in `matching/floors.mjs` and `matching/census-deviations.mjs`, and
every mask in `matching/harness.json`, needs a line here. Without one the gate
has been quietly widened and nothing records who widened it, or why.

- [deviation | floor | mask | a11y] `<region or selector>` — what differs, why
  it is accepted, and the evidence: a spec citation, a census row, a gate run.
